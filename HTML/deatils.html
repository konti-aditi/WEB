         <summary>What is Java used for?</summary>
        <img src="https://logowik.com/content/uploads/images/kotlin.jpg" height="600px" >
        <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language used in a wide array of applications and platforms due to its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability. Its uses include:
Mobile Application Development: Primarily for Android applications, where Java has historically been the dominant language for building native apps, although Kotlin is also gaining popularity.
Web Applications: Used for developing server-side components of web applications with frameworks like Spring and Struts, powering large-scale enterprise web applications and various online services.
Enterprise Software: Java's scalability and robustness make it a preferred choice for developing complex enterprise-level software, including billing systems, supply chain management programs, and other business-critical applications.
Big Data Technologies: Employed in big data processing engines and frameworks like Hadoop for handling, analyzing, and managing large and complex datasets.
Cloud-Based Applications: Its platform independence and ability to run on various underlying systems make Java suitable for building and scaling cloud applications and services.</p>
